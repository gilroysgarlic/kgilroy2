San Ramon Valley High School,"A public high school in the San Francisco Bay Area. I graduated from here in 2020 via livestream. My high school experience was defined by marching band and poetry recitation, so it surprised my entire family when I decided to attend a university known for having cool students.

Grey Whale Cove State Beach,"A state beach about 10 miles from Half Moon Bay. This was where, in 2022, I realized for the first time that I was in love with my partner. We're trying to go back every year.

Norris Camp,"A rough estimate of the location of the Kenneth S. Norris field station. Owned by the UC system, Norris Camp serves as a home base with the specific purpose of teaching students new to the field. When I stayed here, we had a running tally of how many people had been stuck by cacti. Out of a 24-person class, we got up to 13.

Warren Field,"A large sports field at UC San Diego. This is the site of Scrum by the Sea, an annual women's rugby tournament that I have played in twice to date. During the last tournament, my partner (also my teammate at the time) hurt her knee so badly it still acts up to this day.

Olympic Training Center,"The Olympic Training Center. Filled to the brim with training facilities, the OTC is where elite athletes (or, in my case, deeply-stressed 19-year-olds at a winter camp) go to develop their skills. While I was here, rain flooded all of the regular fields, which meant we were on turf without cleats for 4+ hours a day. I considered leaving a bad review on Yelp, but USA Rugby is run by jocks, not meteorologists.
